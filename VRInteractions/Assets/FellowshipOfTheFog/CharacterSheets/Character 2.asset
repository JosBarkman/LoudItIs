  privateInfo: "You were away for a week for a trip. You reasoned your trip as a
    family business but in fact, went to London.\r\nYou returned home from a trip
    at 23 00 and saw your husband talking to some unknown young lady in the garden.
    Probably he hired a new servant.  There was something about her you didn\u2019t
    like from the first second you saw her. And also with the financial situation,
    you can\u2019t afford another servant.  \r\nYou are into occultic arts, it is
    your hobby and big passion. You believe that with rituals you can summon ancient
    spirits and supernatural entities to serve your goals.\r\nThe trip you had was
    not just a tourist trip. You were looking for rare poisons and other ingredients
    for your occultic rituals. You found them and returned home a few days earlier
    than you thought. You couldn\u2019t wait to try the new occultic rituals. Maybe
    this time you will manage to summon a ghost or a spirit? So exciting! \r\nWhen
    you returned home you were extremely excited to try the new ritual out, and the
    new servant pissed you off, so she was a well-suited target.\r\nYour husband
    was walking somewhere in the garden still so you went to the secret basement
    nobody knows about where you keep all your occultic equipment.\r\nYou tried to
    summon an ancient spirit to make the new servant leave the house forever. The
    guy who sold you the poison needed for this ritual worried you that this type
    of magic is dangerous and unpredictable, but what could go wrong? You just asked
    the spirit to make the servant leave.\r\nAfter that, you went back to your room
    and fall asleep. \r\nYou don\u2019t remember if you locked the door to the basement.
    \r\nIn the early morning, you woke up, went to the secret basement door using
    the main stairs, and locked the secret door. You indeed forgot it last night.
    You went back to sleep. "
