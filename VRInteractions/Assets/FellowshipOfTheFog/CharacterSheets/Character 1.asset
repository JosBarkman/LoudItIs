  background: "\n\rCommon bio info:\r\nAristocrat ,Owner of the mansion, Married
    to Ms. Luisa, Very welcoming  \r\nAllowed Geoffrey, his old friend, and his wife
    Josephine, to live in a free room for a while (James has some business in London
    and needed a place to stay)\r\nHis wife returns from a trip the same evening
    as Geoffrey and Josephine (the night before the morning the story starts). \r\n\r\nWhat
    you know:\r\nYou have met a young beautiful woman called Claire. She showed interest
    in you and you could not resist the temptation. After a few months of being your
    lover Claire came to you crying and said that she will have to abandon London
    due to financial reasons and that you will be no longer able to see each other.
    You couldn\u2019t let that happen so you allowed her into your house while your
    wife was away for a week. You decided to come up with a plan later.\r\nYour wife
    returned to the mansion this night, a few days earlier than expected.\r\n\r\nSo
    far you haven\u2019t talked to your wife about Claire, you will make something
    up in the morning when she wakes up\r\nYou know that Josephine is a successful
    writer of detective novels. \r\nFrom 22 00 to 22 30 you had a talk with Claire
    in the garden where you talked about your feelings. \r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the talk
    in the garden, you walked around the mansion for about 2 hours waiting for your
    wife to fall asleep. You need more time to make up an explanation of who is Claire
    so you rather talk to her in the morning. She probably was too tired to talk
    after the trip anyways.\r\nWhen you walked back to the house at 1 30 +- you saw
    a car/ cab arriving so you met Geoffrey and Josephine and showed them their rooms.\r\nAfter
    that, you went to bed. You found your wife sleeping, which was a surprise for
    you. When did she arrive and why was it earlier then she said? \r\n"
