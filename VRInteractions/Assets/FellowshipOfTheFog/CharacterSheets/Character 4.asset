  background: "Common bio info:\r\nAristocrat , wife to Geoffry, writer of detective
    novels. \r\n\r\n\r\nThings you know: \r\nYou are obsessed with the idea of \u201Cthe
    most realistic detective book\u201D.\r\nYou realised the only way to make a truly
    realistic story is to document real life.\r\nSince your husband is a detective
    it works pretty well. You travel with him and document his investigations for
    your books. \r\nYou know that Geoffrey is trying to catch a woman named Caroline
    Black. She seduces rich aristocrats to get into their houses, steals all the
    riches and jewelry she can find, and disappears.\r\nYou know that the investigation
    lead your husband to the mansion of your old friend by pure coincidence. Caroline
    must be in this mansion, maybe as a lover of Robert.\r\nYou would not be satisfied
    with Caroline being caught and imprisoned. It is not a dramatic enough finale
    for your book.\r\nYou tried to imagine how would the story go if Robert figured
    out Caroline was stealing from him and lying about her feelings\u2026 It would
    a more dramatic finale. \r\nYou planned to kill Caroline and make Robert or maybe
    even his wife to look guilty so that you can see the most dramatic story unfold
    and make a perfect base for your book.\r\nWhen you arrived at 2 am and your husband
    fall asleep you decided to walk around the mansion and see what can be used for
    your idea.\r\nYou accidentally found a secret door to a basement with occultic
    stuff and poisons. Robert or his wife (or both seem to be a part of some sort
    of cult). Perfect. This story will be your best one.\r\nYou stole one of the
    poisons. You took a bottle of your perfume and replaced the content with the
    poison. Then you wrote a short letter saying \u201CA present from you know who\u201D
    and placed the bottle with a letter at the door of the young blond lady who must
    be Caroline Black. This way Robert will become the main suspect. \r\nAfter that
    you returned back to bed and fall asleep.\r"
