  commonBioInfo: 'Aristocrat , wife to Geoffry, writer of detective novels. '
  privateInfo: "You are obsessed with the idea of \u201Cthe most realistic detective
    book\u201D.\r\nYou realised the only way to make a truly realistic story is to
    document real life.\r\nSince your husband is a detective it works pretty well.
    You travel with him and document his investigations for your books. \r\nYou know
    that Geoffrey is trying to catch a woman named Caroline Black. She seduces rich
    aristocrats to get into their houses, steals all the riches and jewelry she can
    find, and disappears.\r\nYou know that the investigation lead your husband to
    the mansion of your old friend by pure coincidence. Caroline must be in this
    mansion, maybe as a lover of Robert.\r\nYou would not be satisfied with Caroline
    being caught and imprisoned. It is not a dramatic enough finale for your book.\r\nYou
    tried to imagine how would the story go if Robert figured out Caroline was stealing
    from him and lying about her feelings\u2026 It would a more dramatic finale.
    \r\nYou planned to kill Caroline and make Robert or maybe even his wife to look
    guilty so that you can see the most dramatic story unfold and make a perfect
    base for your book.\r\nWhen you arrived at 2 am and your husband fall asleep
    you decided to walk around the mansion and see what can be used for your idea.\r\nYou
    accidentally found a secret door to a basement with occultic stuff and poisons.
    Robert or his wife (or both seem to be a part of some sort of cult). Perfect.
    This story will be your best one.\r\nYou stole one of the poisons. You took a
    bottle of your perfume and replaced the content with the poison. Then you wrote
    a short letter saying \u201CA present from you know who\u201D and placed the
    bottle with a letter at the door of the young blond lady who must be Caroline
    Black. This way Robert will become the main suspect. \r\nAfter that you returned
    back to bed and fall asleep."
